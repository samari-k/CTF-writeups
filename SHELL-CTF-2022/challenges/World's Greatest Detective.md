We got a png image with some weird characters on it that obviously should be the flag somehow.

The filename says something about "Wakandan Translator". Never heard about it, so I googled it and actually found a Wakandan Translator. Yay!

To check if this is actually it, I typed in "SHELLCTF" and got the same characters as in the challenge picture.

So i let it generate the alphabet in minor and major characters and the numbers from zero to nine and then I just had to find the suiting characters for the flag.
