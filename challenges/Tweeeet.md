So we got an image of birds on a wire.

For a very long time I did not know how to approach this. I actually printed it out and had a look on it during solving some other challenges, but it left me without any ideas. I even did a reverse image search without any success. Then I thought about just googling `birds cryptography` (and thought this will not lead to anything) because I had no more ideas.

The first picture showing up as a search result looked exactly like what I needed to solve this challenge.

It took me hours but it was an easy one in the end. Except it was more OSINT than crypto.
